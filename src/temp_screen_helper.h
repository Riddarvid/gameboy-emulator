/* This is a temporary helper that reads the tempscreen.pixdata file. tempscreen.pixdata is a 160x144 24-bit bmp file
 * with its header removed leaving only the pixel data. The pixel data is in rgb format (ie 3 bytes per pixel) but
 * since all pixels in the tempscreen file are in grey (r, g and b have the same value) scale and all pixels that
 * will be generated by the emulator will be in grey scale we only need to store the r-component in a texture (one
 * byte per pixel). The shaders will do the rest of the work.
 *
 * HERE WE DON'T CARE ABOUT BAD PRACTICES. THIS FILE WILL BE REMOVED SOON!
